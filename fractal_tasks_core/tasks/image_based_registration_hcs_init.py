    Initialized calculate registration task

    This task prepares a parallelization list of all zarr_urls that need to be
    used to calculate the registration between cycles (all zarr_urls except
    the reference cycle vs. the reference cycle).
    This task only works for HCS OME-Zarrs for 2 reasons: Only HCS OME-Zarrs
    currently have defined acquisition metadata to determine reference cycles.
    And we have only implemented the grouping of images for HCS OME-Zarrs by
    well (with the assumption that every well just has 1 image per acqusition).

    Args:
        zarr_urls: List of paths or urls to the individual OME-Zarr image to
            be processed.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        zarr_dir: path of the directory where the new OME-Zarrs will be
            created. Not used by this task.
            (standard argument for Fractal tasks, managed by Fractal server).
        reference_cycle: Which cycle to register against. Needs to match the
            acquisition metadata in the OME-Zarr image.

    Returns:
        task_output: Dictionary for Fractal server that contains a
            parallelization list.
