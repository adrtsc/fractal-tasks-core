# Development

## Setting up environment

We use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs) to manage the development environment and the dependencies. A simple way to install it is `pipx install poetry==1.8.2`, or you can look at the installation section [here](https://python-poetry.org/docs#installation).

Running any of
```console
# Install the core library only
poetry install

# Install the core library and the tasks
poetry install -E fractal-tasks

# Install the core library and the development/documentation dependencies
poetry install --with dev --with docs
```
will take care of installing all the dependencies in a separate environment, optionally installing also the dependencies for developement and to build the documentation.

## Testing

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org) for unit and integration testing of Fractal. If you installed the development dependencies, you may run the test suite by invoking:
```console
poetry run pytest
```

The tests files are in the `tests` folder of the repository, and they are also
run through GitHub Actions; both the main _fractal_tasks_core_ tests (in
`tests/`) and the _fractal_tasks_core.tasks_ tests (in `tests/tasks/`) are run
with Python 3.9, 3.10 and 3.11.

## Documentation

The documentations is built with mkdocs.
To build the documentation locally, setup a development python environment (e.g. with `poetry install --with docs`) and then run one of these commands:
```
poetry run mkdocs serve --config-file mkdocs.yml  # serves the docs at http://127.0.0.1:8000
poetry run mkdocs build --config-file mkdocs.yml  # creates a build in the `site` folder
```

## Mypy

We do not enforce strict `mypy` compliance, but we do run it as part of [a specific GitHub Action](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-tasks-core/actions/workflows/package.yml).
You can run `mypy` locally for instance as:
```console
poetry run mypy --package fractal_tasks_core --ignore-missing-imports --warn-redundant-casts --warn-unused-ignores --warn-unreachable --pretty
```

## How to release

Preliminary check-list:

1. The `main` branch is checked out.
2. You reviewed dependencies and dev dependencies and the lock file is up to date with `pyproject.toml`.
3. The current HEAD of the main branch passes all the tests (note: make sure that you are using the poetry-installed local package).
4. `CHANGELOG.md` is up to date.
5. If appropriate (e.g. if you added some new task arguments, or if you modified some of their descriptions), update the JSON Schemas in the manifest via:
```bash
poetry run python fractal_tasks_core/dev/update_manifest.py
```
(note: in principle this issue is covered by tests, but it is good to be aware of it)

Actual release

6. Use:
```bash
poetry run bumpver update --[tag-num|patch|minor] --dry
```
to test updating the version bump
7. If the previous step looks good, remove the `--dry` and re-run the same command. This will commit both the edited files and the new tag, and push.
8. Approve (or have approved) the new version at [Publish package to PyPI](https://github.com/fractal-analytics-platform/fractal-tasks-core/actions/workflows/publish_pypi.yml).
