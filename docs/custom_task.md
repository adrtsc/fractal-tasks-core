# How to write a Fractal-compatible custom task

The `fractal-tasks-core` repository is the reference implementation for Fractal
tasks and for Fractal task packages, but the Fractal platform can also be
used to execute custom tasks.

For the most recent versions of Fractal (namely `fractal-server` v2 and `fractal-tasks-core` v1), the instructions for building your own tasks are available at https://fractal-analytics-platform.github.io/build_your_own_fractal_task.

As a reference, here is [a copy of the legacy instructions for older Fractal versions](./custom_tasks_old.md), which are currently obsolete.
